## What is React Native CLI?
React Native CLI is the core toolchain for building React Native applications. It provides a robust environment for developers who need more control over the native code of their apps. Here’s what you need to know:

### 1. Flexibility and Customization:
**Native Code Access:** With React Native CLI, you have full access to the native code (Java, Objective-C, Swift) of your app. This means you can integrate custom native modules or third-party libraries that aren’t available in Expo.\
**Custom Native Modules**: You can write your own native modules or modify existing ones, which is crucial for projects requiring specific functionality not provided by Expo.

### 2. Development Workflow:
**Build Tools:** React Native CLI relies on tools like Xcode and Android Studio for building and deploying apps. This setup might require more initial configuration but offers a more traditional development environment.\
**Setup Complexity:** The setup process can be more complex, involving installation of development tools and configuration of environments.

### 3. App Performance:
**Optimized Performance:** Since you have direct access to native code, you can optimize performance to meet specific needs

## What is Expo?
Expo is a framework and platform built on top of React Native that simplifies the development process. It provides a set of tools and services designed to make building and deploying React Native apps faster and more accessible.
### 1. Ease of Use:
**Pre-built Components and APIs:** Expo comes with a rich set of pre-built components and APIs that cover many common use cases, reducing the need for additional libraries.\
**Managed Workflow:** Expo’s managed workflow abstracts much of the configuration and native code complexity, allowing developers to focus on JavaScript and React code.
### 2. Development Workflow:
**Fast Setup:** Expo offers a streamlined setup process with minimal configuration. You can get started quickly with a new project using just the Expo CLI.\
**Expo Go App:** The Expo Go app lets you test your app on a real device without needing to build it manually. This can significantly speed up the development and testing process.
### 3. Limitations:
**Limited Native Modules:** Expo’s managed workflow has a predefined set of native modules. If you need something outside this list, you might have to eject to a bare workflow or use the Expo SDK.\
**Ejecting:** If your project requires custom native code or third-party libraries not supported by Expo, you may need to eject to React Native CLI, which can complicate your development process.

## Key Differences
### 1. Customization vs. Convenience:
**Expo:** Ideal for developers who want to get started quickly and benefit from an extensive library of components and APIs with minimal configuration.\
**React Native CLI:** Suitable for developers needing full control over the native code and the flexibility to integrate custom native modules.

### 2. Development Speed:
**Expo:** Faster setup and development cycle due to its managed workflow and the Expo Go app for instant testing.\
**React Native CLI:** May involve a more complex setup and longer development cycle but offers greater customization and control.

### 3. Use Cases:
**Expo:** Best for projects where the pre-built components and APIs suffice and quick iteration is essential.
**React Native CLI:** Ideal for projects with specific native requirements or where custom native code is necessary.

## Conclusion
Choosing between Expo and React Native CLI ultimately depends on your project needs and development preferences. Expo offers a streamlined development experience with built-in tools and components, making it an excellent choice for many projects. However, if you need extensive customization or access to native code, React Native CLI provides the flexibility required for more complex applications.
